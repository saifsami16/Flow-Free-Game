Messengers â€“ Web programming JavaScript home project.

The code generates a Rectangular Grid in which there are pairs of numbers. The same numbers have to be joined with each other through a line. The game continues until all the numbers are matched with each other.
The game has three levels. Easy, Medium, Hard
Once a certain level is completed, a dialog box appears announcing the Win.
The user can create his account and save the data of his previous wins. The user can also save partially completed games and they can be restored by clicking on the time stamp.
The game also stores the total number of times a certain level has been completed.
The admin account has the previlege of adding or removing new puzzles or levels simply by entering numbers.

The project comprises of two parts:
First part consists of creating the base logic for the game which was mostly implemented in Javascript.
The Second step is about deploying it on an online accessible server and PHP was used for this purpose.
